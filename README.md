<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/vinitapp/Horriseon/blob/main/assets/images/seo.jpg)

Horriseon is a marketing agency. As a front-end and junior developer the most common task is to take the existing code and refactor it to meet certain set of standards or to implement new technology.

While designing a website, there are certain considerations such as:
* Web accessibility- is an increasingly important condideration for the businesses which ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards.
* Accessible site should be better positioned in search engines.

<!-- USER STORY -->
## User Story

This is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who is requesting the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. This follows an AS AN / I WANT / SO THAT format. For example, "AS A shopper visiting an online store, I WANT to place items in a shopping cart, SO THAT I can purchase them."

### Acceptance Criteria

These are the requirements that you must meet to satisfy the scope of work. They are not exhaustive, but they do entail the minimum aspects of a working solution. Consider this a checklist of baseline requirements. Acceptance criteria can be presented in various ways. In this case, we'll use a common format called scenario-oriented criteria which expresses each requirement in a WHEN / THEN format. Don't worry if this doesn't make sense now; it will become very familiar to you after you complete a couple of challenges.

### Process

To begin with:
1. Created new repository in Github with Readme.md file
2. Clone the repo in VS code
   git clone https://github.com/vinitapp/Horriseon
3. Create assests folder for Css style sheet and images
4. The website for Horriseon is designed using Html and Css
